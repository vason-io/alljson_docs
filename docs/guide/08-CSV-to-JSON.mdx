     - paste from clipboard
     - or drag and drop a file
     - or upload a local file

   - Utilize various options for parsing and converting CSV into JSON.

2. Send the parsed JSON:

   - Direct it to the left/right panel via "to left JSON" / "to right JSON" buttons
   - Alternatively, view the CSV in table format by selecting the "Table" tab.

## CSV from Web

Alljson allows you to download CSV content from the internet. To do this, you need to:

    - register in Alljson
    - log in
    - subscribe ( see the topic [HTTP Intro](/guide/http-client-and-automation/intro-http-client) )
    - and write a REST-request in an HTTP editor, for example:

```
  ### example get planets as CSV GET
  https://alljson.com/examples/exampleGetPlanetsAsCSV
```

    - If the HTTP request returns CSV content (Content-Type: text/csv), then by clicking on the appearing 'to csv' link, you can download the content into the 'CSV' window.
