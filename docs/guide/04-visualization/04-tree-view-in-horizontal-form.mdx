# Tree view in horizontal form

[JSON data in a hierarchical horizontal tree form (https://alljson.com/open-htree)](https://alljson.com/open-htree)

The `Horizontal tree` window allows you to analyze JSON data in a hierarchical horizontal tree form,
providing a visual representation for easier understanding and navigation.

import { ThemedImg } from '@site/src/components/ThemedImg';

<ThemedImg name="Tree_view_in_horizontal_form" />

1. Click the `Htree` button on either the left or right side to open the `Horizontal tree` window.
   Opening the `Horizontal tree` window from the left side allows you to analyze JSON content from the left JSON panel,
   while opening it from the right side allows analysis of JSON content from the right JSON panel.
   You can navigate through the JSON by expanding particular nodes or expand all nodes at once using the `Expand all` button.

2. You can synchronize the tree node with the cursor position at the panel you are analyzing the JSON in. E.g.

   - Click somewhere on the JSON text on the left panel
   - Then click on the `▷ Sync` button

3. You may also synchronize the other way around. Just click per node on ◁ to position the cursor in the active JSON panel

4. Additionally, in this window, the following modes are available:
   - `nodes with values` - displaying nodes with both keys and values or only with keys
   - `zoom/pan` - working in zoom/pan mode or scrolling mode
