# Compare panels

The `compare window` enables you to compare the content from two JSON panels.

Click the <DummyButton>compare</DummyButton> button to open the `compare window`.

You can navigate through the differences by using <DummyButton>prev</DummyButton> or <DummyButton>next</DummyButton> buttons.

You can achieve cursor position synchronization between the left/right JSON panel and the corresponding left/right "Compare" window by following these steps:

- Click on a specific location within the left side "Compare" window.
- Next, click the ‚óÅ sync left button.
- This action will automatically navigate you to the corresponding position in the original JSON on the left JSON panel.
