# 3d view

import DummyButton from '@site/src/components/DummyButton';
import ActivePanelSign from '@site/src/components/ActivePanelSign';

The `3D view` window enables you to analyze JSON in 3D form.

Click the <DummyButton>3d</DummyButton> button to open the `3D view` window.

<ActivePanelSign/>

Here you can visualize the JSON in 3D form:

- syncronize the position between the JSON panel and the 3D window;
- expand/collapse nodes (JSON`s arrays and objects) by clicking on the 3D elements;
- it is always possible to track the path to the root;
- decrease the number of analyzed nodes by clicking on "onlySelectedPath".
