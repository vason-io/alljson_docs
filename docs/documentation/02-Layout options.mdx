/>

Additionally, the working area includes the following elements:

1. Buttons for hiding panels
2. Common control elements
3. Button to open the templates and workspaces management window; Toggle button for dark and light themes
4. Control elements for the right or left panels
5. Area for managing open windows, where they can be activated or closed
6. Checkbox for caching the content of the corresponding editor (each left/right panel has its own checkbox)
7. Control elements common to all editors

Pressing the "F1" key in any editor brings up a list of available commands and their shortcuts
