The `XPath` feature enables you to analyze JSON data using the XPath language.

### XPath

The XPath language is typically applied only to XML documents.
However, Vason allows using XPath to analyze the structure of JSON.

### Examples XPath queries

```text
//planets/name /* select key */

(//name)[3] /* select nested node key by index */

//planets[position() >= 1 and position() <= 3]/name /* select key by range */
```
