- [Specification XPath 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/)

### XPath

Jsonata, similar to SQL in the world of databases, serves as a query language within the realm of JSON:

- it offers you select, join, aggregate, sort, filter, and other powerful functionalities;
- you can perform updates on JSON effortlessly;
- conversion of JSON to other JSON structures or alternative text formats becomes feasible.

### Example queries

```text
**.extra.velocity /* select nested node key */

planets[0].name /* select key by index */

planets.extra.{"a": velocity, "b": %.name} /* new json by %parent node */

planets@$P.moons@$M[$M.planet_position=$P.position]{
$P.name: $M.moon
} /* join and group */
```
