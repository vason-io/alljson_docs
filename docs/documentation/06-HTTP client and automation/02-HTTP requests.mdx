### APIs

Retrieve JSON data for analysis by making HTTP requests to different APIs (clouds). Explore and:

- Evaluate prominent APIs from Google or ChatGPT
- Interact with IBM Watson API and Elasticsearch
- Develop and streamline ETL processes using Informatica or IBM Datastage
- Conduct experiments with CI/CD processes on Microsoft Azure.

### Syntax of HTTP-Request

HTTP requests follow this syntax:

To write a request, make sure you use the following **2 mandatory** elements:

- Name of request (will also be used for the script).
  Before the request title, you need to put three hashtags
  {" "}
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#aaaaaa' }}>### name of request</span>
  <br></br>
- HTTP method und URL:
  {" "}
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#008000' }}>GET, POST, PUT or DELETE</span>
  <span style={{ color: '#cd1c1c' }}>URL</span>

**Optionally**, you can include:

- HTTP header(s):
  {" "}
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#c178db' }}>header name: header value ...</span>
- <span style={{ color: '#26bbae' }}>body</span>, This is the textual content,
  for example, in JSON format.<br></br>
  Inside the request, prepend the request body with a blank line.

In URL, headers and body can be included the variables enclosed in double curly braces:
&#123;&#123;<span style={{color: '#f9a156'}}>variable</span>&#125;&#125;. See next topic [HTTP Variables](HTTP%20Variables).

Single-line comments, preceded by a double slash, are allowed anywhere.

<br></br>
<span style={{ color: '#cccccc' }}>//comments</span>

Before several requests, you can specify the name of the request group.
This allows, when there are a large number of requests,
to work conveniently with the structure, including quickly finding requests.
The name of the request group should be preceded by one or two hashtags.

<br></br>
<span style={{ color: '#aaaaaa' }}>## Name of the request group</span>

### Example HTTP-Request

<span>
  <span style={{ color: '#aaaaaa' }}>### example request name</span>
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#008000' }}>GET</span>&nbsp;
  <span style={{ color: '#cd1c1c' }}>https</span>
  <span style={{ color: '#cd1c1c' }}>://dummyjson.com/carts</span>
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#c178db' }}>Accept: application/json</span>
  <br></br>
  <br></br>
  <span style={{ color: '#26bbae' }}>&#123;key: 'example_body'&#125;</span>
</span>
