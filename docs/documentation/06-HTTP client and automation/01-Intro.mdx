# Intro

The HTTP Client provides the ability to send REST requests from the browser to external resources via the HTTP protocol
and receive responses, typically in JSON format.

Vason HTTP Client is a lightweight counterpart to popular applications such as `curl` or `postman`.

Requests in the HTTP Client need to be written in text format (see next topic [HTTP Requests](HTTP%20Requests)).

NOTE: Making HTTP request to third-party services is prohibited by browsers due to CORS security rules

.

Vason provides a CORS-proxy service that solves this issue.
Due to costs associated with maintaining CORS servers, this feature requires premium Vason subscription.

### `HTTP client` window

  }}
/>

1. Click the `HTTP client` button on header to open the `HTTP client` window.

2. A simple HTTP request has the following format:

   - Three hash symbols (###), followed by the title or description of the request
   - On a new line, the HTTP request method (for example, GET) and the resource address (URL)
   - For additional information see next topic [HTTP Requests](HTTP%20Requests)

3. However, since the HTTP Client is the only feature of Vason available by subscription, it is necessary to:
   - Register in the Vason application
   - Log in to the system
   - Subscribe to the premium plan.

### Subscription to the premium plan
