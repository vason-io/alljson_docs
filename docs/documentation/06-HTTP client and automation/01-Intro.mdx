# Intro

[Lightweight online HTTP client (https://vason.io/open-http)](https://vason.io/open-http)

The HTTP Client provides the ability to send REST requests from the browser to external resources via the HTTP protocol
and receive responses, typically in JSON format.

Vason HTTP Client is a lightweight counterpart to popular applications such as `curl` or `postman`.

Requests in the HTTP Client need to be written in text format (see next topic [HTTP Requests](/documentation/HTTP%20client%20and%20automation/HTTP%20Requests)).

NOTE: Making HTTP request to third-party services is prohibited by browsers due to CORS security rules

Vason provides a CORS-proxy service that solves this issue.
Due to costs associated with maintaining CORS servers, this feature requires premium Vason subscription.

To facilitate operations with remote data, Vason features an HTTP client with an integrated scripting system.
This enables users to automate the flow and processing of data. See [Script](/documentation/HTTP%20client%20and%20automation/Script)

   - On a new line, the HTTP request method (for example, GET) and the resource address (URL)
