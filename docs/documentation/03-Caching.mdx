# Caching

### Templates and Workspaces

[vason.io/open-workspaces](https://vason.io/open-workspaces)

To familiarize yourself with examples of Vazon's operation, one of the preinstalled templates can be loaded.

You can also save the content of editors or queries in the browser's memory and work with Workspaces.

Only the selected content is cached in the browser's memory.

### Caching and Saving

To save your documents (JSONs, HTTP requests, variables, script and queries) in the browser's cache, simply select the caching checkboxes.

This will ensure that your texts or queries are consistently updated in the browser cache (IndexedDB) with each modification.

import { ThemedImg } from '@site/src/components/ThemedImg';

<ThemedImg alt="Caching" name="Caching"></ThemedImg>

1. Content or queries in editors/windows, provided the caching checkboxes are enabled, will be saved in the browser's memory by any changes.
2. If caching checkboxes are not enabled, the edited content or new queries <b>WILL NOT BE SAVED</b> upon page reload in the browser.

Always pay attention to the orange triangle to understand whether the corresponding content will be saved or lost upon browser reload

3. When caching checkboxes are enabled in any editor or query window, a new workspace is created based on a previously loaded template.

   - The current loaded Template or Workspace is always shown at the bottom in the right part of the footer
   - The "Templates and Workspaces" window allows you to load Workspaces and manage them. This includes
     - Editing the name or description of the Workspace
     - Deleting the Workspace
     - As well as saving the Workspace to the file system or loading it from there.
   - Additionally, for each Workspace, it indicates: from which Template it was created and which components are cached.

4. The "Templates and Workspaces" window also allows you to load Templates, providing examples of how Vason works.
